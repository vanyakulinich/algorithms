### One of popular algorithmic tasks: Validation of string with brackets

String can include only "[", "(" and "{" brackets and its matches, e.g. "[]{}()"<br/>
The string is valid when brackets are "paired":

- "[]{}()" - valid
- "[]{})" - not valid
- "[{}]" - valid
- "[}]" - not valid

 <br/>
 This task is solved via one iteration ( O(n) ) with the help of stack data structure
